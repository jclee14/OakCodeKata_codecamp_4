This one, Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner, has Chang globetrotting around the planet with a different celebrity in tow for each episode. Think Kate McKinnon in Cambodia, Chrissy Teigen in Morocco, you get the idea. For most shows, the pairing of the celebrity and the destination makes no logical sense, which is something of a headscratcher. Do we care what Kate McKinnon thinks of Cambodia, even though she\'s never been there and knows little about the place? The only one that pairs well is Seth Rogen in his hometown Vancouver.

The video shows Woolie wearing a makeshift hazmat suit and wielding a bullhorn while reciting Bible passages and referring to the church as a \"cult.\"\n\n\"You have doctors telling you to stay home and slow the spread, and you have a pastor that\'s like, \'Let\'s get together and celebrate,\'\" Woolie told The Livingston Parish News. \"I understand the role of the church, but I wanted to make an example.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday Facebook post, the pastor said he would be holding a press conference to address the situation on Thursday. The briefing is set to include a message of support from former Alabama judge Roy Moore, who lost two campaigns for a U.S. Senate seat after news of his alleged sexual assaults of underage teens emerged.\n\nSpell has claimed that he is being persecuted for being a Christian, insisting that his religious rights should take precedence over concerns about transmitting a potentially deadly disease.\n\n\"It\'s not a concern. The virus, we believe, is politically motivated. We hold our religious rights dear and we are going to assemble no matter what someone says,\" Spell told WAFB on March 17.\n\nThe pastor also claimed that the \"anointed handkerchiefs\" he offers at the church have the power to heal multiple diseases, suggesting that the handkerchiefs could also be effective against COVID-19.\n\n\"Cancers are healed here, people are healed of HIV in these services, and we believe that tonight, we\'re also going to pass out anointed handkerchiefs to people who may have a fear, who may have a sickness, and we believe that when those anointed handkerchiefs go, that healing virtue is going to go on them as well,\" said Spell.\n\nNewsweek reached out the Life Tabernacle Church for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.','2020-04-01 00:00:00',3,NULL),(9,'R.I.P. ADAM SCHLESINGER: 5 SONGS TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF THE FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE FRONTMAN','Adam Schlesinger, the co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, died Wednesday morning due to coronavirus complications, according to Variety.\n\nThough Fountains of Wayne was most known for the hit single \"Stacy\'s Mom,\" Schlesinger was also an Emmy-winning songwriter for the CW musical comedy series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. He received an Oscar nomination for writing the title song to That Thing You Do, directed by Tom Hanks, as well as two Tony nominations for his work on the musical adaptation of John Waters\' film Cry-Baby in 2008. In addition to his songwriting, Schlesinger produced recordings for such musical artists as The Monkees, Dashboard Confessional, They Might Be Giants and Robert Plant.\n\nSchlesinger was hospitalized last week after being exposed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It was reported that his condition was improving on Tuesday, and his family told Billboard at the time that they were \"cautiously optimistic\" that he would fully recover.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Chris Collingwood\'s publicist for comment.

Feeling the heat of the moment, the newlyweds decided to recommit themselves to the marital experiment, and Taylor even let Brandon sleep in the bed.\n\nUnfortunately, their marital bliss won\'t last long. On the upcoming episode of Married at First Sight, set to air on Wednesday, Taylor and Brandon will be back at odds as they prepare to join the other Season 10 couples on a marriage retreat.\n\nIn an episode 14 sneak peek (below) exclusive to Newsweek, Taylor and Brandon experienced a dreadfully awkward car ride on their way to the couple\'s retreat. It all starts when Brandon decides to take a nap during the long journey instead of talking about what\'s bothering him.\n\n\"I know that we need to talk, but I\'m not ready. So I thought it would be a great idea for me to go to sleep,\" Brandon said during a confessional video.\n\nBy now, it\'s pretty obvious when Brandon is in a mood, and Taylor picks up on it right away. According to her, he may be upset that she decided to go hang out the night before the retreat. But it\'s anyone\'s guess as to what he\'s actually mad about considering the fact that he won\'t talk about it, and Taylor\'s forced to enjoy the ride in silence.','2020-04-01 00:00:00',11,NULL),(11,'TRUMP, BARR AND ESPER WARN OF MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL TRAFFICKING DURING CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE BRIEFING','President Donald Trump opened Wednesday\'s coronavirus White House task force briefing by issuing a warning about Mexican drug cartels.\n\n\"America continues to wage all out war to defeat the virus, this horrible, horrible virus, you see how terrible it is especially if you look at the numbers from yesterday,\" Trump said after taking the podium. \"In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us achieve a total victory.\"\n\nThe president stood alongside Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General William Barr and several other officials, none of whom were situated six feet apart despite the federal government\'s social distancing guidelines.\n\n\"As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there\'s a growing threat that cartels, criminals and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain and we must not let that happen,\" he continued. \"Today the United States is launching enhanced counternarcotics operations in the Western hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics.\"\n\nTrump said the government will increase their efforts in \"surveillance, disruption and seizures of drug shipments.\"\n\nEsper took the podium next and announced that the Department of Defense had commenced \"enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea... to combat the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S.\"','2020-04-01 00:00:00',4,NULL),(12,'BIDEN\'S RUNNING MATE NEEDS TO WIN HIM AN ENTIRE STATE, NOT JUST A CONSTITUENCY | OPINION','The last Democratic debate was a snooze fest. Aside from the pro forma Trump-bashing, this time over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the only memorable moments were former Vice President Joe Biden\'s promise to pick a woman as his running mate and appoint a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court nomination is blatant pandering to a key Democratic constituency. One might prefer he commit to considering candidates on their merits and legal experience rather than gender or skin color, but that would go against what it means to be a member of his party these days.\n\nOf much greater interest is his plan for the vice presidency, an office he held for eight years under former President Barack Obama. Even though some will say otherwise, it\'s not at all ghoulish to point out how, to put it subtly, the former vice president is bumping up against the upper ranges of the actuarial tables. If victorious, Biden\'s ticket mate may end up occupying the Oval Office sooner than anyone voting Democrat in November might think.\n\nThe vice presidential candidate always comes under scrutiny, especially when the media starts probing for weaknesses that could hurt the top of the ticket. George McGovern\'s chances in 1972, which were already slim to none, weren\'t helped when the public learned his original running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, had at one time undergone electroshock therapy. Walter Mondale\'s 1984 campaign against Ronald Reagan was hurt by ethical issues concerning the business affairs of his running mate\'s spouse. And it\'s generally agreed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin did more to drag John McCain\'s 2008 campaign down than she ever did to boost it up.\n\nVice presidential choices matter, even if running against them is a nonstarter. Michael Dukakis found that out in 1988, when he warned about the possibility of \"President Quayle\" instead of focusing on George H.W. Bush\'s vulnerabilities. Picking Al Gore helped Bill Clinton \"pick the GOP lock\" on the Electoral College in 1992, and eight years later, Gore was almost lifted into the White House by Florida voters who backed his selection of Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman for the No. 2 slot on his ticket.\n\nMany political analysts are predicting that Biden\'s pick will come from among the women who ran against him in the primary, most likely Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren or Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Both, after all, were endorsed by The New York Times, and neither hit him too hard during any of the debates. They haven\'t said anything particularly damaging that the media and GOP could exploit, and both have won office on their own.\n\nNevertheless, these analysts are wrong. Neither Warren nor Klobuchar helps Biden get any closer to the White House than he is now. The most important thing a running mate can do is deliver a state to the ticket that may be out of reach. Providing an ideological balance is nice but not usually helpful. Winning in a state you\'re not expected to, as both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton found out in 2016, can be everything.\n\nThe Democrats have Massachusetts. And the progressives who bow to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on every issue aren\'t going to be any more persuaded to vote for Biden with Warren on the ticket. The one thing that unites most Democratic primary voters is the desire, some might call it an aching wish, to see Trump kicked out of office.','2020-03-23 00:00:00',12,NULL),(13,'TO BEAT TRUMP, A WOMAN OF COLOR VICE PRESIDENT IS MORE THAN A CONSOLATION PRIZE. IT\'S A NECESSITY | OPINION','Looking at the remaining two white men competing for the Democratic nomination to take on fellow white man President Donald Trump, I feel a familiar heartbreak. A grief known to many women of color whose brilliance is passed over, again and again, as we are told to wait our turn. Elizabeth Warren\'s recent decision to suspend her campaign has compounded that tremendous sense of loss.\n\nIt\'s a feeling that has grown since Julian Castro dropped out, followed by Kamala Harris and then Cory Booker. The Super Tuesday contests last week basically sealed the fate of this historic Democratic primary: Either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden will compete against Trump, ending my dream that a woman or man of color, or a white woman who carried our issues, would have a clear shot to lead our nation.\n\nBut Democrats can\'t win on grief. They need the enthusiasm of women of color like me to win. Without us, the country will suffer another four years of Trump.\n\nOnly a historic increase in the number of voters of color, especially women of color, will deliver the swing states that Democrats must carry to win. This is what we saw in 2018, when Democrats took back the House of Representatives with a 37 percent rise in turnout among women of color from the 2014 midterms. This is what we are hoping for in 2020.\n\nSo how do we get there? How do we motivate voters of color and ensure that 2020 can still be a year of positive political transformation? We get there with a woman of color vice president on the Democratic ticket.\n\nSome are calling the vice presidency a consolation prize, but it\'s much more than that. It\'s a winning strategy and likely a necessity.\n\nWomen of color have the numbers to generate a Democratic victory—if we show up at the polls. In swing states across the country, women of color dominate Democratic voter rolls. We are a third of Democratic voters in Florida, North Carolina and Texas. In Georgia, we\'re 44 percent. For us to show up like we did in 2018, we need Democrats to prove that they still care about us, see us and value us.\n\nIn 2016, the decision to put Tim Kaine on the ticket was supposed to be the \"safe\" choice, but he failed to inspire half the enthusiasm the congresswomen of \"the Squad\" do every day. That year, the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania saw a huge drop-off in turnout among women of color who previously voted for President Barack Obama—and the states all went to Trump.','2020-03-20 00:00:00',13,NULL),(14,'OUR RIGHT TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER IS IN REAL DANGER—BUT IT CAN STILL BE SAVED | OPINION','\"The system was blinking red.\" That is what an intelligence official reportedly said about briefings President Donald Trump and congressional leaders received in January about the spread of coronavirus and its potential to become a pandemic.\n\nAs we are all now aware, Trump and his administration ignored the intelligence briefings and nearly all the warning signs. They failed to adequately warn the public, they failed to develop enough tests critical to tracking the virus\'s spread, and they failed to ensure hospitals had sufficient ventilators, masks, hospital beds and other essential resources to treat the sick.\n\nThe result is a government scrambling to catch up to a virus as it spreads across our nation at alarming speed, killing, already, over 2,300 Americans.\n\nWhat started as a public health crisis has now turned into an economic crisis, with jobless claims already surging to a record 3.28 million in one of the first weeks of this crisis alone. And if we don\'t act soon, it will turn into a crisis for our democracy too.\n\nThe system is once again blinking red, and this time it\'s warning us about our ability to hold elections in November. Without action, and soon, Americans\' right to vote is in real danger in the era of coronavirus.\n\nThe acute public health crisis and the gaping hole it is leaving in our economy need to be top priorities at the moment. But if Washington fails to make changes now to how we vote, our nation will be just as unprepared to hold an election this fall as we were to fight the virus this spring.\n\nAlready, we have seen 13 primaries postponed due to the coronavirus: Alaska, Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Louisiana, Kentucky and Puerto Rico. And the ugly truth is that this is probably just a preview of what\'s about to come.\n\nUnless we are able to flatten the curve—a task nearly impossible with Trump\'s illogical and dangerous determination to ignore the advice of experts and push the country to re-open for business, and with large states like Florida refusing to issue shelter-in-place orders—modeling suggests that it will be 12 to 18 months before we get the coronavirus under control. And while some experts suggest the virus\'s spread may slow this summer, it is expected to spread rapidly again as winter approaches. Which means the November election, the most important election that will be held in generations, could be held in the middle of an uncertain global pandemic.','2020-03-30 00:00:00',14,NULL),(15,'BOEING, BERNIE, STOCK MARKET PORN...AND NEIL YOUNG! | OPINION','Welcome to \"On the Street,\" my first column for Newsweek.com. Every Monday, I\'ll give you my take on major stories in the world of business and economics—and politics where it intersects with both. To save you a slog through LinkedIn, a little about me: I\'m editorial director of Newsweek. Previously, I have worked in jobs ranging from a reporter and columnist for the Wall Street Journal and the Boston Globe, respectively, to deputy editor at Fortune magazine. I\'m also the author of You Can\'t Fire Everyone, a management memoir. (As it turns out, you can, I guess.) So let\'s get started. Lots of pandemic-related bailout stuff, obviously:\n\nBeware Market Porn\nThe S&P 500 stock index closed up for the week last Friday—just north of 10 percent—mostly on the news of the bailout, Fed moves and who-knows-what-else. For most of us, that shouldn\'t be a signal to get back in the stock pool or out for that matter. But if you have been reading the various financial sites, there have been a slew of articles encouraging investors to start investing again. Or prodding them to do it. For readers, pure stock porn. You know, here\'s what Warren Buffett may or may not be doing or saying. Or Goldman Sachs just loves Boeing. Or Bill Miller says the coronavirus bear market is one of the best buying opportunities ever. But you\'re not Miller, and you\'re not Buffett, and you have no idea whether the bailout is going to get the economy going again and when. There\'s a lot of irresponsible rubbish out there, in the guise of advice. But if you\'re a normal investor—as most of us are—spend some time with Newsweek\'s Diane Harris on managing the ups and downs of the insane equity markets. My favorite point: market timing is for dummies. Amen, Harris.\n\nCan You Believe Boeing\'s Chutzpah?\nSo let me get this straight. Management almost drove the company into the ground when a software flaw was discovered in its spanking new 737 Max planes, resulting in the crash of two jetliners—and causing endless woes for customers like American and Southwest after the whole fleet was grounded for more than a year. If that wasn\'t enough, the board of directors thought it was a great idea to go ahead with the company\'s first quarter dividend. After all, there\'s nothing better than rewarding shareholders just after you\'ve screwed up the company. As the Washington Post\'s Allan Sloan wrote in his recent column, \"If you want to see an act of utter cluelessness given what\'s going on in our country, look at how Boeing sent more than $1 billion of dividend checks to its shareholders three weeks ago, as the coronavirus crisis and corporate stimulus requests were both metastasizing.\" The grand finale was brought to you by Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun. Last week, on Fox, he said he wasn\'t willing to give company stock in exchange for a taxpayer bailout. Calhoun added: \"If they forced it, we\'d just look at all the other options and we have got plenty.\" Go ahead, then, Boeing, handle it on your own. You\'re so good at everything else.','2020-03-30 00:00:00',15,NULL),(16,'MOST WILL SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC. BUT NOW IS THE PRUDENT TIME TO SETTLE YOUR AFFAIRS | OPINION','Many of us do not like to think about dying, or even the possibility of dying. Recent neurological research suggests that our brains are actually incapable of identifying the \"I\" with \"death\" in the same straightforward, visceral way that they might identify \"I\" with \"lunch tomorrow.\" The notion of \"this won\'t happen to me\" is hardwired into our perception of the self.\n\nBut it will.\n\nAnd this risk—of the inevitable happening much sooner than we\'d ever planned for—is painfully present in our minds today. The coronavirus pandemic is still wildly out of control, with the United States emerging as the new epicenter of the virus. We still don\'t know how many people in the country have it, and we don\'t yet know how many people will be infected before a course of treatment or an immunization are developed, particularly given that many carriers are asymptomatic.\n\nWith a global death rate of 4.4% among known cases, including many people who would not be classified in the \"high risk\" categories of over 65 or with underlying medical conditions, each of us must now face an important, if uncomfortable truth.\n\nYou—the person reading this—might not survive. And it is time to get your affairs in order, if you haven\'t already.\n\nIt has been time, of course, even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tragedies, accidents, and illnesses often strike people when they least expect it, and sometimes are least ready for it. But now, in the early stages of a devastating pandemic, it is time for us all to do the painful but necessary work of preparing for the possibility of our own worst case scenarios coming to pass.\n\nGod willing, they won\'t. And this certainly doesn\'t come as a call to lay down our arms and stop doing our best to outlive this and work for best outcomes for everyone. But it\'s better to be prepared for a situation that will inevitably arrive- even if hopefully not for many years to come—than to face calamity without your wishes carefully clarified, and bequeathing your friends and loved ones not only heartbreak and grief, but a plethora of exhausting and sometimes crass administrative conundrums.\n\nThe to-do list isn\'t long.','2020-03-30 00:00:00',16,NULL),(17,'HERE IS WHY THOSE COVID-19 PREDICTIONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE | OPINION','For those of us who believe in numbers, this is a trying time. Estimates of the number of people who might die from coronavirus are all over the place. There is the projection from a team composed of researchers from London\'s Imperial College and the WHO Collaborating Center for Infectious Disease Modeling that says up to 40 million people could die this year from coronavirus. 2.2 million of those would be in the U.S. Two articles published on Medium predicting up to ten million deaths in the U.S. by Tomas Pueyo have been viewed over forty million times and cited by Tom Friedman in the New York Times. (Pueyo is vice president of growth at a San Francisco start-up.)\n\nThose estimates sound really bad, and are, although it\'s hard to deal with numbers that big. Here\'s one way to look at it. British anthropologist Robin Dunbar has calculated the number of people an average person knows well, is acquainted with, can recognize, etc. Using Dunbar numbers, that means in the worst-case scenario, on average ten people you know would die, including at least one who is in your close circle. Now of course deaths will not be distributed evenly, but it\'s a useful way to get our heads around what it might mean for each of us personally.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with that. Ten days ago UMass Amherst\'s Flu Forecasting Center of Excellence surveyed 18 infectious disease modelers and came up with a prediction of 195,000, with only a 0.06 chance deaths would exceed 1.5 million. If 195,000 die in the U.S., then that means that on average one person you kinda-sorta know might die, and in a typical U.S. town there would be about a half dozen deaths. Nobel Prize winner Michael Levitt of Stanford also expects the toll to be much less, as does a team from Oxford University.\n\nWhy are the numbers so all over the place? Well, part of it is the nature of modeling off a small data set. That\'s risky business. The Hall of Fame pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm hit a home run in his first at bat. A model would have predicted he\'d be the next Babe Ruth, but he never hit another one.\n\nThe biggest unknowns with coronavirus are when it really started, how many people are at risk, and what the mortality rate is. If the contagion started a month ago, then it\'s rising at an incredible rate. But the team from Oxford thinks it might have started two months ago, and if that\'s the case, it suggests that it\'s much less of a risk than we think, perhaps because a significant portion of the population is immune. That\'s what Levitt thinks. He notes that even on the Diamond Princess, only 712 of the 3,711 got sick and 8 died. His inference is that some portion of the population must have a natural immunity. Of course if eight out of every 3711 people in the U.S. died, that\'d still be 700,000.\n\nBut the bigger reason for the wildly divergent projections is because the outcome depends to a large extent on what we do next. It\'s hard for most of us to get our heads around scenarios with names like \"Suppression\" vs. \"Mitigation.\" Last week a team of modelers from the University of Texas led by Remy Pasco and Xutong Wang presented some plain language estimates to the city of Austin. Their model concluded that if the city does nothing, 10,908 people could die. But if it closes schools and people strictly adhere to social distancing, that number drops to 267. Wow.','2020-03-30 00:00:00',17,NULL),(18,'CHINA MAY HAVE PREVENTED OVER 700,000 COVID-19 CASES WITH ITS STRICT CONTROL MEASURES TO STOP SPREAD, SCIENTISTS SAY','The tough measures taken by China to stop the spread of the new coronavirus in the first 50 days of the COVID-19 pandemic likely prevented 700,000 cases, according to a study.\n\nAfter a mysterious new disease for which there is no treatment or vaccine began sickening people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province, in December 2019, officials took steps including quarantining millions of people to try to slow the rate of infection.\n\nAs shown in the Statista graphic below, the virus has since arrived on every continent except Antarctica. According to Johns Hopkins University, of the more than 877,400 total COVID-19 cases worldwide, 82,361 have been confirmed in China.\n\nOn January 23, China set its public health threat status to 1, its highest possible level. As part of the response, all cities closed their schools, isolated suspected and confirmed patients, disseminated information about the disease, and gave migrants health checks. The next day, travel from Hubei was banned in what is thought to be \"the largest attempted cordon sanitaire in human history,\" the authors of the research published in the journal Science wrote. Overall, entertainment venues were closed and public gatherings banned in 220 cities, while in 136 cities intra-city transport was stopped, and travel within 219.\n\n\"The dispersal of COVID-19 from Wuhan was rapid. A total of 262 cities reported cases within 28 days,\" the scientists said.\n\nAs the COVID-19 virus is so new, how it is transmitted and whether its spread can be slowed is poorly understood, the team explained. More generally, while the spread of infectious disease has been \"intensively studied,\" it\'s uncertain whether travel restrictions and social distancing measures prevent further transmission.','2020-04-01 00:00:00',18,'As many haven\'t caught the new coronavirus it is likely \"a large fraction of the Chinese population remains at risk of COVID-19,\" warned the authors of the study published in the journal Science.'),(19,'Over 200,000 Have Recovered From Coronavirus, Per Johns Hopkins University','More than 200,000 people have recovered from a new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a metric that officials have urged the public to consider.\n\nCases rose to 952,171 on Thursday, and the United States remains the epicenter of the outbreak with 216,722 cases, according to a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University. The virus has claimed the lives of 48,320 people and as the death toll rises, so does the public level of fear and panic.\n\nThe big picture of the situation is now \"painfully clear,\" according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. However, he also reiterated that many people who contract the virus will recover. About 80 percent of those who test positive won\'t require medical intervention and even those who enter the hospital can return home. As of Wednesday, 6,101 people in New York had been discharged from the hospital.\n\n\"You don\'t often focus on this line when we have these conversations,\" Cuomo said during a Monday press briefing. \"But people go into the hospital and people leave the hospital, and that is important to remember.\"\n\nIn the U.S., 8,672 people have already recovered, according to the tracker. In China, 76,571 people reportedly have recovered from the virus so far. With 82,431 cases, that gives China a recovery rate of about 93 percent.\n\nSpain and Italy, where officials have implemented national lockdowns, have seen 26,743 and 16,847 recoveries, respectively. Italy was hit hardest of any European country and on Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told El Pais, an Italian newspaper, that the country is in the most \"acute\" phase.\n\n\"Experts are still cautious, but it is reasonable to think that we are near the peak,\" Conte explained.','2020-04-02 00:00:00',19,'While it may be hard to focus on the number of recoveries when the death toll continues to rise, officials have cited it as an important aspect of the pandemic to remember.');
