<h1><u>The Millionaire Fastlane</u></h1>
<h3><u>M.J. DeMarco</u></h3>
<p>
    Is the financial plan of mediocrity-a dream-stealing, soul-sucking dogma known as The Slowlane-your plan for creating wealth? 
    You know how it goes-go to school, get a <b><i>good</i></b> job, save 10 percent of your paycheck, buy a <b><i>used</i></b> car, 
    cancel the movie channels, quit drinking <b><i>expensive</i></b> Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, 
    trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day you can retire <b><i>rich</i></b>. The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river. 
    For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to "settle for less," and a <b><i>slight</i></b> chance of <b><i>elderly</i></b> riches, 
    there is an expressway to <b><i>extraordinary</i></b> wealth that can burn a trail to <b><i>financial</i></b> independence faster than any road out there. 
    Demand the Fastlane, an alternative road to wealth that actually ignites dreams and creates millionaires <b><i>young</i></b>, not old. Hit the Fastlane, 
    crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live <b><i>rich</i></b> for a lifetime.
